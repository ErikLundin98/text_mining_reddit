- Extract relevant data from dataset, map reddit posts to stocks

# Research questions

- How does the sentiment for stocks compare between different subreddits?
- Is there a difference in correlation between sentiment and stock price movements for the different subreddits (when comparing different sentiment analysis models and time horizons)?
- Use sentiment from different feature models and train a classifier on it to predict

- Would an investment strategy based on the sentiments for different subreddits be viable (for my own sake)
